<h2>Where can you find steroids for sale online?<h2>
  
Steroids. More people than ever are now taking them, which means that more people than ever are now trying to find them for sale online. The question is: can this be done? And if so, where can they be found. 

In today's article we will use our expert knowledge to delve deep into the world of steroids and PEDs - and specifically into where they can be found and how to remain safe when making a purchase online. We know it can be dauting buying grey/black market goods online for fear of being scammed, so we've decided to put together a guide for all those that want to take the plunge and take steroids, but aren't quite sure where to begin.

Before we do examine this topic in a little more depth we've like to say something regarding steroid usage. Don't worry - we're not here to lecture you. We respect everybody's right to do whatever they please, however we do encourage safe use of steroids. Please carry out sufficient research prior to starting and cycle, and always a consult a healthcare professional before, during and after every course. 


<h3>Is it safe to purchase anabolics from the internet?</h3>

Staying safe when making a purchase online is absolutely paramount. The last thing anyone wants is to lose their hard earned money. Unfortunately, the steroid market does have a small amount of untrustworthy sellers, therefore one must remain cautious and vigilant when attemtping to source gear online. But how can this be done? By following several rules which we feel will give you the best chance of staying safe and avoiding scammers.

1) Extensive research: Understandably, when someone is emarking on taking steroids for the first time it can be an exciting feeling. However, this can lead to people being over-eager and wanting to get started ASAP, which may result in them rushing into a purchase. This is the cardinal sin where steroid are concerned. RUshing into a purchase is definitely not something that anyone should do as it increases the chances of being scammed. 

To avoid this we advise extensive research. Get yourself onto <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ff9900;">Google</a></strong> and search for any steroid related search term and you will be presetend with a vast array of websites all purporting to sell genuine anabolics. But which actually do? Well, this is where steroid review sites come into play. These websites are a godsend for potential buyers as they allow them to see indepedent reviews of both online stores and brands/UGLs. Without these sites it would be much more difficult to buy safely. 

The two sites we suggest using are: 
<a href="https://eroids.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ff9900;">eRoids.com</span></a> and <a href="https://musclegurus.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ff9900;">MuscleGurus.com</span></a>
  
If you can't find the site you're looking to use then we recommend doing a Google search for it or browsing the numerous bodybuilding forums that currently exist.

In addtion, only purchase from stores that are located in your country, and always make a small test order first. 

<h3>What is the safest payment method to use?</h3>

This is one question that we get asked more than any other. Because people are so used to using their credit card or debit card to make purchases online they naturally wonder if they can buy steroids the same way. Unfortunately, many steroid suppliers seem to be obsessed with telling people that using card or Paypal isn't anonymous, and therefore isn't safe. However, this doesn't give the full picture. 

No payment method is fully anonymous, be it wire transfer, money transfer (such as Western Union or Money Gram), card payments, Paypal etc. Some has to send and someone has to recieve, and these details will be logged somewhere along the line. The reason that suppliers will tell you not to use card is because it offers you - the buyer = more protection. If something goes wrong then you can merely ask your bank to do a chargeback (which the supplier will not appeal against becasue of the nature of their business). It's the same for Payapl too. Other payment methods however (like the one mentioned previously) offer buyers very little protection, therefore it is in the interest of the seller to only take these forms of payment.

Most suppliers that take card will take all types, but Visa and Mastercard are the most popular.

<h4> Which types of steroids can be bought online?</h4>

In short, pretty much every steroid can be bought online. But, you must be aware than some steroids are faked more than others. The more expensive the steroid is to produce, the more likely it is to be faked, as suppliers want to increase their profits so they will often underdose or completely replace the compound with something cheaper (Winstrol instead of Anavar for example). 

Here are a list of the most commonly available <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabolic_steroid" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="color: #ff9900;">steroids</span></a> you'll find online:

<b>Injectables</b>: Testosterone enanthate/cypionate/propionate/decanoate/undecanoate/suspension/andriol. Nanadrolone decanoate (Deca Durabolin)/Phenylpropionate (NPP). Trenbolone acetate/enanthate. Boldenone (Equipoise). Drostanolone (Masteron) Enanthate/Propionate. Dihydroboldenone (DHB). Primobolan.

<b>Orals</b>: Dianabol. Anadrol. Winstrol. Anavar. Turinabol. Halotestin. Superdrol. M1T. Proviron.

If you follow the above guidelines then you give yourself the best chance of finding and buying steroids without issue. We hope you found this guide useful. Thank you for reading.
